# My-Dinogotchi
Project 0 - Made a tamagotchi like game 


1. User will navigate to game and will see set of instructions as well as be asked to enter a baby name.

2. Once name has been entered press start and the game will begin

3. User will see that there are 3 things you must do to keep your pet alive. Do not let him reach 10 in Tired, Hunger or Bored. He will die if he reaches 10 in any of these 

4. Starting off his Hunger will be at 4
    Tired and Bored will start at 0. 

5. Every 2 seconds - Tired, Hunger, and Bored will go up one number 

6. There will be buttons to Feed, Play, and make him go to Sleep so that the numbers will stay low (0 is where you want all 3 numbers to always be)

7. Every 10 seconds the dinosaur will go up in age and user will see him grow. Keep him alive long enough so he can live a long happy life. 

8. Once your baby reaches 18 years old he could fend for himself and the game is over for the user who should feel like a proud parent! (:
