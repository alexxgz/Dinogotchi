# My-Tamagotchi
First project - Made a tamagotchi like game 


1. User will navigate to game and will immediately be prompted to enter name for pet.

2. Once name has been entered click anywhere on screen to wake up your new pet 

3. You will see that there are 3 things you must do to keep your pet alive. Do not let him reach 10 in Tired, Hunger or Bored. He will die if he reaches 10 in any of these 

4. Starting off his Hunger will be at 4
    Tired and Bored will start at 0. 

5. Every minute inactive all 3 - Tired, Hunger, and bored will go up one number 

6. There will be buttons to Feed, play, and make him go to sleep so that the numbers will stay low (0 is where you want all 3 numbers to always be)

7. Every 5 minutes the dinosaur will go up in age and you will see him grow. Keep hime alive long enough so he can live a long happy life.
